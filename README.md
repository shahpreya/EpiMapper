EpiMapper

Welcome! This repository carries out core analyses and visualizations for exploring the utility of interictal iEEG functional connectivity on predicting outcomes in surgically-treated drug resistant epilepsy patients, using knowledge of the surgical resection zone.

This serves as a supplement to our paper in preparation, entitled "High interictal connectivity within resection zone is associated with 
favorable post-surgical outcomes in focal epilepsy patients." Please see paper for details on image acquisition, processing, and analysis.
